Finding the right co-packer (or co-manufacturer) is a huge milestone for any food or beverage brand. But what if you can’t visit their facility in person? Whether you're across the country or overseas, it’s still possible to vet a co-packer thoroughly—without ever stepping foot on-site.
Here’s how to do it right.

1. Ask the Right Questions
Before anything else, schedule a video or phone call with the co-packer and come prepared with detailed questions. Don’t just focus on pricing—dig deeper into how they operate.
Ask questions like:
What certifications do you hold (FDA, USDA, SQF, Organic, etc.)?
What kind of products do you specialize in?
What is your average turnaround time for production?
Can you handle my MOQ (minimum order quantity)?
What happens if there’s a quality issue?
These questions give insight into how they work, how they communicate, and whether they’re a good fit for your brand long-term.

2. Request Photos and Video Tours
If you can’t walk through the facility yourself, ask them to send recent photos or pre-recorded videos of the production floor, equipment, storage areas, and packaging lines.
Even better? Request a live virtual tour. Many co-packers are open to giving you a walkthrough over Zoom or Google Meet. This lets you:
See cleanliness and organization
Observe safety and hygiene practices
Get a feel for their operational setup
It’s not quite like being there, but it’s the next best thing.

3. Talk to Other Clients
A trustworthy co-packer should be willing to provide client references—ideally, brands in a similar category as yours. Don’t hesitate to reach out and ask:
What has your experience been like?
How do they handle delays or mistakes?
Are they transparent and easy to reach?
These real-world insights can make or break your decision.

4. Review Certifications and Audit Reports
Ask for copies of any third-party audits or certifications, such as:
GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices)
HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point)
SQF (Safe Quality Food)
Allergen control programs
Organic, Kosher, or Gluten-Free documentation
These documents show that the facility follows industry-standard safety and compliance practices, even if you can't verify them in person.

5. Start Small
Still unsure? Ask to start with a small pilot run or trial batch. This way, you can test their product quality, responsiveness, and reliability—without committing to a huge order.
Use this trial to observe:
How they handle communication
Whether timelines are met
Product consistency and packaging quality
A successful first run builds confidence and lays the groundwork for a strong partnership.
