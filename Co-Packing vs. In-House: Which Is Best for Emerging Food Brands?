Starting a food brand is exciting—but it’s also filled with big decisions. One of the most important choices you’ll face early on is how to handle production. Do you keep it in-house, or do you partner with a co-packer?
Both options have pros and cons. Choosing the right path can make the difference between growing steadily and hitting a wall. So let’s break it down.
What Is Co-Packing?
A co-packer, short for "contract packer," is a company that manufactures and packages your food product for you. You supply the recipe and brand, they handle the rest—equipment, staff, safety compliance, and packaging.
Why Consider Co-Packing?
1. Lower Startup Costs Buying your own commercial equipment isn’t cheap. Co-packers already have what you need, which means you avoid a hefty upfront investment.
2. Scalability Want to go from 500 jars to 5,000 in a month? Co-packers are built for that. They can grow with you—fast.
3. Focus on What You Do Best Marketing, brand-building, recipe development—that’s your zone of genius. Let someone else handle the logistics of making your product.
4. Built-In Compliance Food safety and regulations are serious business. Co-packers are already equipped to meet FDA, USDA, and other standards, helping you avoid costly mistakes.
What About In-House Production?
Going in-house means making your product yourself, in your own facility, using your own equipment and team. This approach gives you more control, but it also comes with bigger responsibilities.
Why Go In-House?
1. Full Creative Control You oversee every step, from ingredient sourcing to final packaging. That’s a huge plus for brands that prioritize craft, freshness, or customization.
2. Flexibility with Small Batches Need to tweak a recipe mid-run? Want to test a seasonal flavor? In-house production lets you pivot quickly without negotiating with a third party.
3. Direct Quality Assurance When your name’s on the label, quality matters. Producing in-house gives you peace of mind that every product meets your standards.
The Trade-Offs
Let’s be real—both paths have their risks. Co-packing can sometimes mean long lead times, minimum order quantities, and less flexibility. On the flip side, running your own facility can stretch your budget, time, and energy thin—especially in the early stages.
So, Which One’s Right for You?
Here are a few questions to ask yourself:
Do you have the capital and time to manage your own facility?
Are you planning to scale quickly?
Is your product highly sensitive or secret?
Do you value speed and efficiency over hands-on control?
If you're just starting out and want to test the market without overspending, co-packing might be your best bet. But if you're building a niche brand that values craftsmanship and you have the resources, in-house could give you the edge.

Bottom Line: There’s no one-size-fits-all answer. The best choice depends on your goals, budget, and capacity. Start small, stay flexible, and remember—how you make your food is just one part of the recipe for success.
