When working with product manufacturing companies, it's essential to know exactly what you're getting into. A co-manufacturing agreement can open doors to scaling your business and improving efficiency, but it also comes with risks. Before you sign anything, asking the right questions can help you avoid costly mistakes and ensure your product is in the right hands.
Here are the top questions you should ask before signing a co-manufacturing agreement:
1. What is your experience in manufacturing products like mine?
Not all product manufacturing companies are the same. You want a partner who has experience with your type of product—whether it’s food, cosmetics, supplements, or electronics. Ask about previous clients, product types, and production methods to ensure they have the right knowledge and equipment for your needs.
2. What are the minimum order quantities (MOQs)?
Co-manufacturers often have minimums that might be higher than what your business can handle at the moment. Understanding the MOQs will help you decide if the partnership is financially viable. Make sure the quantity aligns with your current demand and inventory strategy.
3. What quality control systems do you use?
Quality can make or break your brand. Ask how the manufacturer ensures consistency, checks for defects, and handles recalls. Request to review their certifications and quality control reports. A trustworthy company will have nothing to hide.
4. Can I visit your production facility?
A site visit tells you more than any brochure or email ever could. Touring the facility lets you evaluate cleanliness, safety, workflow, and employee treatment. It also shows that the company is confident in its operations and open to transparency.
5. How do you handle intellectual property (IP) protection?
Your formulas, designs, and branding are your business’s most valuable assets. Make sure the agreement clearly outlines how your IP will be protected and who owns what. Don’t move forward until this is crystal clear in writing.
6. What happens if there’s a delay or product issue?
Delays and mistakes happen, but how they’re handled matters. Ask about timelines, penalties for delays, and how disputes are resolved. Having these terms in your agreement will save you stress later.
7. How flexible is your production capacity?
If your business grows quickly, will your co-manufacturer be able to scale with you? Conversely, can they handle smaller runs if you’re testing a new product? Flexibility is key to long-term partnerships.
8. What are your payment terms?
Clarify when and how payments are expected. Some product manufacturing companies require large upfront payments, while others offer more lenient terms. Make sure the terms fit your cash flow situation.
Final Thoughts
A co-manufacturing agreement is a big step. It’s not just about production—it’s about trust, quality, and shared goals. Asking the right questions will help you choose a manufacturing partner who aligns with your vision and values. Take your time, do your research, and never be afraid to walk away if something doesn’t feel right. Your product—and your brand—deserve the best.
