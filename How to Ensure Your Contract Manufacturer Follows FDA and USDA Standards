When working with a contract manufacturer, it’s crucial to make sure they follow FDA and USDA standards. These regulations help protect public health by ensuring that food, supplements, and other consumer products are safe, properly labeled, and made in sanitary conditions. If your manufacturer doesn’t comply, your business could face product recalls, legal action, or damage to your reputation.
Here are some steps you can take to ensure your contract manufacturer meets these important standards:
1. Verify Certifications and Registrations
Start by checking if the manufacturer is registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), if applicable. Ask for proof of registration and any third-party certifications such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), or ISO standards. These certifications show that the facility is regularly audited and follows strict quality protocols.
2. Review Their Compliance History
You can research whether the manufacturer has had any past violations. The FDA’s website provides access to warning letters, inspection results, and enforcement actions. If the company has a history of repeated violations, consider it a red flag. You want to work with a partner that takes compliance seriously and has a clean record.
3. Request a Facility Tour or Audit
If possible, visit the manufacturing facility. During the tour, observe cleanliness, employee hygiene, and how raw materials are stored and handled. If you can’t visit in person, request a virtual tour or ask for a recent third-party audit report. A reputable manufacturer will be transparent and willing to share this information.
4. Ask About Quality Control Procedures
A strong quality control (QC) program is a sign that a manufacturer is serious about compliance. Ask questions like:
Do they test raw materials and finished products?
How do they handle product recalls or customer complaints?
What documentation do they keep for each batch?
FDA and USDA standards require clear record-keeping and traceability, so make sure the manufacturer can provide this.
5. Include Compliance in Your Contract
To protect your business, include a clause in your manufacturing agreement that requires the facility to maintain compliance with all relevant FDA and USDA regulations. The contract should also include language about liability, audits, and the right to terminate the agreement if standards are not met.
6. Stay Involved and Informed
Regulatory requirements can change over time. Stay updated on FDA and USDA rules, and check in with your manufacturer regularly. A good partner will appreciate your involvement and work with you to ensure continued compliance.
Conclusion
Ensuring that your contract manufacturer follows FDA and USDA standards is not just a box to check—it’s a key part of protecting your brand and your customers. By doing your due diligence, asking the right questions, and staying engaged, you can build a strong, compliant partnership that supports long-term success.
