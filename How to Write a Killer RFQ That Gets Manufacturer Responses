Tired of sending RFQs (Requests for Quotation) into the void—only to get crickets in return? If you're not getting the manufacturer responses you hoped for, the problem might not be them. It could be your RFQ.

Let’s face it—manufacturers are busy. They receive dozens, sometimes hundreds, of RFQs a week. If yours is vague, confusing, or incomplete, it’s likely getting ignored or tossed into the “maybe later” pile.

But don’t worry. Here’s how to write an RFQ that grabs attention and gets you the answers (and quotes) you need—fast.

1. Start with a Clear Subject Line or Intro
If you’re emailing your RFQ or submitting it through a platform, your subject line or opening sentence matters. Be specific. Instead of “Product Quote,” write:

“RFQ: Custom 20oz Stainless Steel Tumblers – 1,000 pcs, Q4 Delivery”

Right away, the manufacturer knows what you're asking for and the volume you're interested in.

2. Introduce Yourself Briefly
Manufacturers want to know who they’re dealing with. Are you a small business? A retailer? A product developer?

Include:

Your name and company

A quick sentence about what your business does

Your role in the company (especially if you're the decision-maker)

Example:
Hi, I’m Lezel from GreenLeaf Living, an eco-friendly lifestyle brand. I handle sourcing and production.

3. Be Specific About the Product
This is where most RFQs fall flat. Don’t make the manufacturer guess what you want. Spell it out:

Product name and purpose

Dimensions and weight

Materials and finishes

Color options

Packaging requirements

Target price (if you have one)

Certifications (e.g., FDA, CE, ISO)

Pro tip: Attach reference photos or drawings. A picture is worth a thousand back-and-forth emails.

4. Quantity and Timeline
Be clear about how many units you need and when. Are you looking for:

A sample order?

A one-time batch?

Ongoing production?

Include your ideal production and delivery timeline. If you're flexible, say so. But give them something to work with.

5. Ask the Right Questions
Instead of just saying “please quote,” ask specific questions to help you compare suppliers better. For example:

What's the cost per unit at different order volumes (e.g., 500, 1,000, 5,000)?

What are the mold or tooling costs?

What’s the sample lead time and production lead time?

What’s your MOQ (minimum order quantity)?

Do you offer customization or white labeling?

6. Keep It Professional but Friendly
Use polite, clear language. Avoid fluff. Manufacturers appreciate direct, respectful communication. A friendly tone goes a long way, especially if you’re looking to build a long-term relationship.

Final Tip: Format Matters
Structure your RFQ with bullet points or clear sections. Avoid walls of text. Make it easy to read. Busy suppliers will thank you—and reply faster.

Bottom Line
A great RFQ isn’t just a request. It’s your first impression. Make it count.

By being clear, detailed, and respectful, you increase your chances of getting solid manufacturer responses—and building long-term sourcing partnerships that grow your business.
