When you see a food product with a certification label, it may just look like a fancy stamp of approval. But behind that stamp is a complex system of safety standards, inspections, and compliance protocols—all designed to protect consumers and help brands earn trust. For consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands, understanding food safety certifications isn’t just helpful—it’s essential.
Let’s break down the big names in food safety: SQF, FSMA, and more, and how they impact your business.

What is SQF—and Why Should CPG Brands Care?
SQF stands for Safe Quality Food. It’s a globally recognized food safety certification program managed by the SQF Institute. Being SQF-certified means your facility follows strict food safety and quality control practices—from sourcing raw materials to packaging finished goods.
CPG brands love SQF because:
It’s part of the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI), which is trusted worldwide.
It helps open doors to major retailers and distributors who require certified products.
It reduces the risk of food safety incidents and recalls.
For brands looking to scale, an SQF certification can be your golden ticket into big-box stores and export markets.

FSMA: The Law That Changed Everything
While SQF is voluntary, FSMA—the Food Safety Modernization Act—is the law of the land in the U.S.
Signed in 2011, FSMA gives the FDA more power to prevent foodborne illness rather than just respond to it. Under FSMA, food manufacturers must:
Create and follow a Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) plan.
Document and monitor every step in their supply chain.
Be ready for FDA inspections at any time.
If you’re selling food in the U.S., FSMA compliance isn’t optional. Whether you’re making snacks, sauces, or supplements, FSMA sets the rules you must follow.

Other Key Certifications to Know
Beyond SQF and FSMA, there are several other certifications that CPG brands may need or benefit from:
HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point): A foundational system for identifying food safety risks. Often required before obtaining GFSI-recognized certifications like SQF or BRC.
BRCGS (Brand Reputation Compliance Global Standards): Another GFSI-recognized food safety certification, popular in Europe.
ISO 22000: An international standard that combines food safety management and continuous improvement.
Organic, Non-GMO, Kosher, and Halal Certifications: These may not be food safety certifications per se, but they add layers of trust and open doors to niche markets.

Why This Matters for CPG Brands
Today’s consumers want more than tasty food—they want safe, responsibly made products. And retailers want to stock brands they can trust.
Food safety certifications prove that your brand takes quality seriously. They help you:
Build consumer trust
Access global markets
Reduce risk
Stay compliant with changing regulations
In a crowded market, certifications like SQF and FSMA compliance are more than just checkboxes—they’re competitive advantages.

Bottom line? Food safety isn’t just a backroom process. It’s a brand builder. So if you’re serious about growth, it’s time to get serious about certification.
