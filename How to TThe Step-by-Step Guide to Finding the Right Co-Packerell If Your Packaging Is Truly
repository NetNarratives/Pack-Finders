When your food or beverage business starts to grow, handling everything on your own gets tricky. That’s where co-packers come in. A co-packer (short for contract packager) helps you produce, package, and sometimes even ship your products. But choosing the right one? That’s a big decision. Here's your step-by-step guide to finding the perfect co-packer for your brand.

Step 1: Know Your Needs
Before you start searching, get clear on what you need. Ask yourself:
What kind of product am I making (dry goods, frozen, liquid, etc.)?
How much volume do I need per run?
Do I need packaging, labeling, or shipping help?
Not all co-packers offer the same services. Knowing what you're looking for helps you narrow down your choices.

Step 2: Do Your Research
Start searching for co-packers that specialize in your product category. Use Google, industry directories like Specialty Food Association, or platforms like CoPack Connect that match you with the right production partner. Read reviews, browse their websites, and look for client testimonials.
Pro tip: Look for companies that are transparent about their capabilities and minimum order requirements.

Step 3: Check Certifications and Compliance
Your co-packer must meet food safety standards. Check if they’re certified by recognized authorities like:
FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration)
USDA (if it’s a meat product)
SQF, BRC, or GMP certifications
These ensure your product is made in a safe, clean environment.

Step 4: Ask the Right Questions
When you start reaching out, don’t just ask for pricing. Ask about:
Lead times and flexibility
Storage and warehousing options
Minimum and maximum production runs
How they handle delays or mistakes
A good co-packer should feel like a partner, not just a vendor.

Step 5: Visit Their Facility
If possible, visit the facility before signing anything. This lets you see the operations up close and confirm they align with your standards. If a visit isn’t possible, ask for a virtual tour or photos.

Step 6: Start Small
Before jumping into a big contract, ask for a test run or pilot batch. This helps you check the quality, packaging, and timeline. If everything runs smoothly, you’ll feel much more confident moving forward.

Step 7: Communicate Clearly
Once you choose your co-packer, set clear expectations. Have a contract that includes timelines, pricing, responsibilities, and quality standards. Regular check-ins can help prevent miscommunication and keep your production on track.

Final Thoughts
Finding the right co-packer takes time, but it’s worth the effort. The right partner can help you scale, improve quality, and focus more on growing your brand. Take it step-by-step, ask questions, and trust your gut—because your product deserves the best.
