So, you’ve taken the first big step—you submitted your Request for Quote (RFQ). Whether you’re launching a new snack brand or scaling an established product line, you’re probably wondering: Now what?
Good news—this is where the magic happens. Here's what you can expect next, step-by-step, after submitting your RFQ through CoPack Connect’s streamlined platform.

1. Confirmation & Initial Review
Immediately after you submit your RFQ, you’ll receive an email confirmation that your request is in the system. Behind the scenes, the CoPack Connect team begins reviewing your submission to ensure it’s clear, complete, and ready to be matched with qualified co-packers.
Tip: The more specific your RFQ details—product type, run size, packaging needs, certifications—the faster the matchmaking process.

2. Smart Matching Begins
CoPack Connect isn’t a public job board. It’s a curated matchmaking system. Based on your RFQ, the platform identifies co-packers in its vetted network who are a strong fit for your product category, production volume, and logistical needs.
Whether you need a peanut-free bakery, a kosher-certified snack line, or a small-batch beverage filler, your request is matched only with relevant and capable co-manufacturers—saving you hours (or weeks!) of cold outreach.

3. Introductions & Responses (3-5 Business Days)
Next, qualified co-packers begin reviewing your RFQ and deciding whether to respond. Within 3 to 5 business days, expect to receive interest from potential partners. These responses often include:
Capability summaries
Estimated timelines
Clarifying questions
Ballpark pricing
Rather than sifting through generic messages, you’ll be engaging with co-packers who are actually interested and able to produce your product.

4. Start the Conversation
Once you receive replies, it’s your turn to connect. Use this phase to ask questions, set up calls, request samples, or visit facilities if needed. Remember, this is about building a relationship with a team you’ll trust to bring your product to life.
You’re not locked into anything yet—this is your chance to vet your options.

5. Decision Time: Choose the Right Partner
After you've compared responses and had initial conversations, you can decide who best fits your business needs. From there, you’ll move into formal quoting, negotiations, and—finally—production.
CoPack Connect’s job is to take the guesswork out of co-packer sourcing. No more emailing random facilities, waiting weeks for a reply, or hitting dead ends. With your RFQ submitted, you’ve already accelerated the search process.

In Summary
Submitting an RFQ on CoPack Connect is just the beginning—but it sets a powerful chain in motion. From smart matching to fast responses, the platform is built to help you find the right partner—faster, easier, and with less stress.
If you haven’t submitted your RFQ yet, now’s the time to do it. And if you already have—get ready. Your product’s next chapter is just around the corner
