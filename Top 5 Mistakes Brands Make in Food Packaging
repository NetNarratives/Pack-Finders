In today’s health-conscious, regulation-heavy world, food packaging isn’t just about looking pretty on a shelf—it’s about safety, trust, and legality. One wrong label or overlooked requirement can lead to fines, recalls, or worse—damage to your brand’s reputation.
Whether you’re a startup selling organic cookies or a global brand launching a new snack line, staying compliant with food packaging laws is a must. Yet many companies—big and small—still make these five common mistakes.
1. Mislabeling Ingredients or Allergens
This is the #1 reason products get pulled off shelves. Whether it’s a missing allergen warning or an incorrect ingredient list, mislabeling can be dangerous and even life-threatening to consumers. In the U.S., the FDA requires the top 9 allergens (like peanuts, milk, and soy) to be clearly listed. In the EU, labeling rules are even stricter.
Tip: Always double-check your ingredient list, especially if you’re using shared manufacturing spaces. Partner with a food scientist or regulatory expert to ensure accuracy.
2. Ignoring Country-Specific Rules
Each country has its own rules for packaging. What works in the U.S. might get you in trouble in Canada or the EU. For example, certain health claims allowed in the U.S. are banned in Europe. Even the order of nutritional information or required font size can vary.
Tip: Never copy-paste your labels from one country to another. Instead, research local requirements or work with a compliance specialist familiar with your target market.
3. Using Unapproved Packaging Materials
It’s not just the food that matters—the packaging itself must be safe. Materials that come into direct contact with food must be approved for use. If your packaging leaches harmful chemicals or isn’t certified for food contact, you could be facing legal trouble.
Tip: Always source packaging from reputable suppliers who can provide compliance certificates. If you’re using sustainable materials, check if they meet food-grade standards.
4. Making Unverified Health Claims
Saying your granola bar “boosts immunity” or “lowers cholesterol” might sound like a great marketing angle—but unless it’s scientifically proven and approved, it’s a fast track to regulatory scrutiny. Even words like “natural” or “light” come with strict definitions.
Tip: If you want to use a health claim, back it up with credible research and ensure it meets regulatory standards. Consult FDA or EFSA guidelines before printing anything bold.
5. Poor Traceability and Lot Coding
In the event of a recall, brands must be able to trace where a product came from, when it was made, and where it went. Without proper batch codes or production tracking, this becomes a nightmare—and a major liability.
Tip: Implement clear lot coding and maintain detailed records. It not only keeps you compliant but also protects your brand in case of a recall.

Final Thoughts:
Food packaging compliance isn’t just about avoiding fines—it’s about protecting consumers and building trust. The brands that win long-term aren’t just creative; they’re careful. By avoiding these five common mistakes, you’ll not only stay on the right side of the law—you’ll also earn customer loyalty.
Compliance is a commitment. Make sure your packaging speaks safety, clarity, and integrity.
