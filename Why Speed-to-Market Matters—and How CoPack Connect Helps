In today’s fast-paced world, speed can make or break a brand. Whether you’re launching a new beverage, snack, or supplement, getting your product to shelves quickly can mean the difference between becoming a trendsetter—or missing the trend entirely. That’s where speed-to-market becomes crucial.

What is Speed-to-Market?
Speed-to-market is how fast a company can develop a product and deliver it to consumers. In industries like food and beverage or health and wellness, trends change fast. If your product launch drags on for months, you may fall behind competitors who move faster—and win shelf space and market share before you even debut.

It’s not just about being fast—it’s about being first, while still keeping quality and compliance intact.

Why It Matters More Than Ever
Here are three reasons why speed-to-market is now a must-have strategy:

Trends are short-lived. TikTok, Instagram, and wellness influencers can make a product viral overnight. If you’re not ready to launch when interest peaks, you may miss the moment.

Retailers expect readiness. Buyers want to see shelf-ready products, not just prototypes. The faster you can meet packaging, labeling, and compliance standards, the faster you get stocked.

Cash flow depends on velocity. The longer your product sits in development, the longer you delay revenue. Speed means you test, learn, and grow sooner.

The Problem: Slow and Fragmented Supply Chains
Unfortunately, bringing a product to market is rarely simple. Startups often juggle multiple vendors—one for sourcing, one for co-packing, one for labeling, another for logistics. Delays happen. Miscommunication causes rework. Finding the right co-manufacturer alone can take weeks—or months.

This is where CoPack Connect steps in.
