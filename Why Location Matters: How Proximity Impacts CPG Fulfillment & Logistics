When it comes to consumer packaged goods (CPG), location matters more than you might think. In fact, how close your fulfillment center is to your customers, suppliers, and transportation hubs can make or break your logistics operations. From reducing delivery times to lowering shipping costs, proximity plays a major role in keeping your CPG brand competitive and efficient.
Faster Delivery, Happier Customers
Speed is everything in today’s on-demand world. With same-day and next-day delivery becoming the norm, being close to your target market gives you a huge advantage. If your fulfillment center is located near major population centers or your primary customer base, you can meet tight shipping windows more easily. That means fewer delays, better customer satisfaction, and more repeat business.
Lower Shipping Costs
Distance equals dollars in logistics. The farther your products have to travel, the more you pay for transportation—whether it’s by truck, rail, air, or sea. Strategic proximity to carriers, ports, and final-mile delivery routes allows you to reduce freight costs significantly. Even shaving off a few hundred miles per shipment can lead to massive annual savings for high-volume CPG brands.
Greater Supply Chain Efficiency
Choosing the right fulfillment location also affects your upstream logistics. Are you near your raw material suppliers or co-manufacturing partners? If not, you may be dealing with unnecessary delays and added costs. A well-placed fulfillment hub creates a smoother, faster supply chain—one where goods move efficiently from source to shelf.
Flexibility in Inventory Management
When your fulfillment centers are located closer to key retail partners or direct-to-consumer channels, you gain more flexibility in managing inventory. You can restock faster, pivot to demand surges, and better handle returns. This proximity helps reduce overstocking or understocking, minimizing waste and optimizing warehouse space.
Risk Reduction and Disaster Planning
Natural disasters, traffic jams, or labor strikes in a far-off region can disrupt your entire supply chain. By diversifying fulfillment locations and keeping them strategically close to your customer zones, you reduce risk. If one node goes offline, others can pick up the slack, helping you maintain business continuity.
Sustainability Benefits
Proximity doesn’t just save time and money—it’s better for the environment too. Fewer transportation miles mean lower carbon emissions, helping you reach your sustainability goals. Many CPG brands are now rethinking their fulfillment footprints as part of their ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) strategies.
Final Thoughts
In the competitive world of CPG, where margins are tight and customer expectations are high, location is a powerful lever. It affects everything from your shipping speed and cost to your environmental impact. Whether you’re building out your own logistics network or partnering with a third-party logistics (3PL) provider, always remember: where you fulfill matters just as much as how you fulfill.
